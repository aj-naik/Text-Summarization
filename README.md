# Text-Summarization
Text summarization using Transformers. 

# Project History
I wanted to create an abstractive text summarization app as a tool to help in university studies. Researched and tried various models for text summarization including LSTMS and RNNs etc. The output was okay enough from a project point of view but not good enough for actual use case. Transformers are produce good enough output for real world use case. According to my experimentations with both T5 and Pegasus, the latter produced slightly better output than T5.

# To Do
1. Create a web app and host on cloud platforms for easy usage.
2. Build a chrome extension for use in web site (More portable and faster than web app).
